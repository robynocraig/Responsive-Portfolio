      <p>Hello internet and thank you for visiting my portfolio! Professionally, I have almost 10 years of technology experience. I have over 13 years of broadcast media experience as well. In the technology world, I have worked in quality assurance, project management and numerous content management systems. I am currently enrolled in a class to become a full-stack web developer.</p>

      <p>Personally, I am married and live in St. Paul, Minnesota. I have three dogs who are my pride and joy: Dorrie, Flossie and Leonidas. My wife and I work with a local dog rescue group. We foster dogs from a shelter in Tennessee. I also re-did and maintain their website, along with help on social media. In my free time, I enjoy watching and attending sports, traveling and Jeopardy!</p>

      <p>I hope you find my portfolio worthwhile and feel free to reach out to me for any needs I can assist with!</p>
